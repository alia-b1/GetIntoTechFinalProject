From start to finish this (just over two hour movie)amazing movie keeps its audience entertained with non stop laughs, tears and overall enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI must admit that since \"I am Sam\" I have never left a movie feeling as happy as I did with Love Actually. It has a good, positive feeling about it which really is the centre of this masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe storylines sound confusing but really they are simple to follow and comprehend. 8 different love stories that interwine and end on an amazing climax on Christmas Eve. \r\n\r\nThe actors, the story, the scenery, the overall spectacle of this brilliant film have definately added it to my top 10 list alongside The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.\r\n\r\nFor a feel good, funny, dramatical masterpiece I strongly recommend it to anyone and everyone.'),
(2, 'She\'s like the wind', '2018-03-04', 2, 2, 'This movie has stood the test of time. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze make movie magic with the sultry dance moves. The choreography and the music make this a ride you will not want to get off of. Now considered a cult classic, it has spawned a television series, Broadway production and most recently a remake (that was horrific). Fantastic piece of celluloid history that ought to be revisited every now and again.'),
(3, 'Heartbreak Mountain!', '2018-02-05', 3, 3, 'For all of those who are holding back from watching this movie because it is \"gay\" or has love scenes between two men...oh! This movie has nothing to do with sex...and to be honest, I don\'t feel that it has much to do with homosexuality. This is the most beautiful and profoundly sad love story I have ever come across, and the fact that it is a love between two men is beside the point. It\'s about a love between two people who cannot be together, but if human beings were better at being human, and if the world was a better place, they would have lived out their lives side by side. I was so, so moved. AMAZING!!!! A must see.'),
(4, 'Pretty good movie', '2018-01-08', 4, 4, 'Wow! Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute. I was really moved by the blend of humor and romance. The romance was what really moved me. I thought that Edward (Richard Gere) and Vivian (Julia Roberts) looked good in the attire they wore to the opera in San Francisco. Oh, boy, if you ask me, Julia Roberts did, indeed, look like a pretty woman in this movie. PRETTY WOMAN really tugged at my heart and soul and made me laugh at times. Don\'t say I have a twisted sense of humor, but I laughed really hard when Edward yelled at Stuckey (Jason Alexander) to get out of his hotel room. If I ever travel to Beverly Hills, I\'m going to stay at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, that is, if I can afford it. Before I wrap this up, I\'d like to say that I think Richard Gere and Julia Roberts each deserved an Academy Award for their performances. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this star-studded hit to anyone who\'s a fan of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts. You\'ll laugh, you might cry, you\'ll be touched, and you\'ll want to see this box-office smash over and over again.'),
(5, 'I <3 Mr Darcy', '2017-12-18', 1, 5, 'Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can\'t chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long.'),
(6, 'Star crossed and starry eyed', '2017-11-07', 2, 6, 'I\'m a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their \"lives will pay the forfeit of the peace.\" We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that\'s because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven\'t seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you\'ll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who\'s who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo\'s best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I\'d rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren\'t getting it, it\'s Romeo is the \"knight in shinning armor,\" Juliet is the angel of Romeo\'s dreams, and Romeo\'s best friend is the comic relief. There\'s other things you\'ll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he\'s a villain). Both families you\'ll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you\'re a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It\'ll sweep you off you\'re feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love.'),
(7, 'Beastly not beautiful', '2017-10-09', 3, 7, 'The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless and spiritless. I do appreciate that they didn\'t want to change the story much and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie was slightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don\'t really make sense and don\'t add up.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know whom should be blamed for the \'emotion delivery failure\' is it the cast or the director? Emma Watson is good actress for some certain roles, but certainly not this one. She was very stiff. We couldn\'t differentiate her surprise from anger or love from sadness. In many scenes Belle and the Beast were talking so fast with no emotions, soul or spirit. It was as if they were rehearsing on a play by reading out loud from their scripts and the director was simply not there.\r\n\r\nCinematography had a problem too. Too many close ups. The original cartoon had some close ups too, but Do they really have to copy everything as-is? The couple dancing scene cinematography could have been better.\r\n\r\nI really don\'t advise anyone to see this movie. Disney failed this time. It happens, though!. Hopefully we\'ll know what really happened.'),
(8, 'Say I\'m a Bird...!', '2017-11-09', 4, 8, 'This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.\r\n\r\nEven most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I\'ve seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.'),
(9, 'Richard Curtis at his best', '2017-10-29', 1, 9, 'The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, `Four Weddings and a Funeral,\' directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar. Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next. Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he\'s had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp. Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him. It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it\'s only-- as they say-- the beginning.'),
(10, 'Lucky me', '2017-11-01', 2, 10, 'I watched this movie on Memorial Day, and was reminded all over again that freedom isn\'t free. So if you are a past or present member of any branch of the US Armed Forces, or if your loved one has paid the ultimate sacrifice with their life, fighting for our freedom, please accept my heartfelt thanks.\r\n\r\nI LOVED this movie. Everyone did an excellent job with their character – especially with Logan. So much feeling and emotion in his expression and actions, even when no words were needed. I felt like I could see into his very soul. I saw a young man who still can hardly grasp the fact that he has survived 3 tours of war in the middle east, when many of his comrades didn\'t come home. You can sense the depth of emotion and turmoil, and can easily understand why it was often hard to just find words to express himself. You can see the military training and discipline, the steel resolve to control his reactions, even when harassed by the town bully/ex-husband. There\'s also loyalty, concern for others, tenderness, selflessness, willingness to work hard – he\'s the man of every woman\'s dream! \r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to see that Beth is a survivor of an extremely abusive marriage. Even though she\'s now divorced, she\'s still not free from the abusive and controlling ex-husband. She\'s very careful in how she responds or endures his abusive threats, in order to keep him from going into a greater rage? and I cheered for her when she finally found the courage to speak up and take control of her own destiny. \r\n\r\nKeith, the ex-husband, is easy to despise, for his hateful, snarly, manipulating character? and yet in the end we saw a little glimpse of good in his soul as well? a little glimpse of what he might have been if he\'d only been willing to humble himself and get help much earlier. \r\n\r\nI loved the happy ending, I loved the story, and I very much appreciated that the producers kept it clean. I can\'t wait for the DVD – this is a keeper!!'),
(11, 'Hot Stuff!', '2018-04-10', 4, 11, 'Hot Fuzz: The story tells us of an over-active \'policeman officer\', Nicholas Angel (Played by the co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg) who is sent to work his duties out in the countryside, to avoid his use of excessive arrests. Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed \'accidentally\'. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.\r\n\r\nBut what can I say? It\'s just hilarious! An incredibly funny, witty, intelligent British comedy that manages to bring you to tears with laughter and also offers extremely well directed and executed action scenes! If you liked the likes of Shaun of the Dead, you\'ll love this, simple as that. I was oddly surprised to find that it was incredibly violent, albeit, in a cartoony way, but it will definitely make you squint. Plenty of cameo\'s by the likes of the hilarious Bill Bailey and a great cast will make this a action/thriller/comedy hard to forget! Excellent.'),
(12, 'What happens in Vegas...', '2018-02-06', 1, 12, 'I just saw the first screening of the movie, and it is very worth the money you will pay for it. I was skeptical about it at first, thinking that the previews would have only the funny parts, but they are just the tip of the iceberg... Everyone hit a home run in this movie. Even Mike Tyson generated a few laughs for everyone. If you need a pick me up from a bad day, just watch this and you will definitely feel better about everything that may be going wrong in your life. I will DEFINITELY be buying this to watch over and over again once it comes out on DVD, probably even see it in theaters again. I hope you find this review helpful because this movie is definitely a must see in my opinion.'),
(13, 'You can\'t sit with us...', '2018-01-28', 3, 13, 'Though my own high school days are well behind me now, this film received enough acclaim that I was convinced to give it a try. Mean Girls did in fact prove to be a rewarding experience. The film made a ton of money and launched some of its young stars into orbit.\r\n\r\nOur story deals with a previously home-schooled girl (Lohan) now having to brave a suburban high school for the first time. She is completely clueless as far as what it takes to be cool in this new world, but she is pretty enough to catch the attention of the most popular girls in the school. The \"Plastics\" as they are called take the young lady into their world and over time she becomes one of them. The more popular the young lady becomes, the more miserable her life becomes, however.\r\n\r\nThe film is very funny and it hits pretty hard with its depictions of the various cliques at modern high schools. Some would argue that the characters in this film are just stereotypes, but so are most real life high schoolers. Nearly everyone fit into one category or another even back in my school days, but things seem even more fragmented now.\r\n\r\nTina Fey has written an intelligent script, and thankfully the film was cast well enough to carry it. Lindsay Lohan is charming, but nothing too exceptional. Rachel McAdams pretty much steals this film, and she is likely the cast member who will have the best career of this bunch. I think it\'s safe to say her scream toward the end of act 2 is the best I\'ve ever heard in any film.Lacey Chabert is also worth mentioning, and she seems worthy of some better roles in the future. Overall, there did not seem to be any casting problems.\r\n\r\nMark Watters keeps things moving along at a brisk pace, and it seems strange to see Lorne Michaels\' name in the credits of any film this funny. From what I\'ve heard, the film had to be trimmed of more than a few parts that would have given it in an R-rating. BOO!!!!!! Hard to argue with the box office totals, though! After watching this film, I was reminded of a similar group of popular girls at my high school. They called themselves the Senior Bitch Patrol, and behaved much the same way as the \"Plastics.\" Only back then (88-91) it was mostly about the hair. The bigger the hair, the more popular the girl. All of these girls have gone on to live boring and pointless lives since those days. Go figure....'),
(14, 'There\'s something in your hair...', '2018-03-04', 4, 14, 'The shock comedy aside (zipper and hair gel scenes), purposeful unpolitically correct moments (humor at expense of handicapped, animal cruelty), the most surprising thing about this film is it has heart and is rather sweet. It\'s not the completely nasty, cruel comedy you might have been expecting. There\'s a nice love story in here too. It\'s corny and cliche\'d and doesn\'t feel overly cloying because there are enough shockingly funny moments to offset it. The acting is good, the pacing brisk, and the jokes, well... you\'ve heard all about the best ones by now.'),
(15, 'Supergood, actually', '2018-04-03', 3, 15, 'Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it\'s \"losers try to get laid\" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it\'s awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It\'s sweet, it\'s funny as hell, and it\'s established a load of new talent.'),
(16, 'An Education in Rock', '2018-02-07', 2, 16, 'Dewey Finn is a lazy freeloader and a guitarist in a rock band who plays gigs every night and sleeps every day, in his friend Ned Schneebly\'s apartment. One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn\'t pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn\'t go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. \r\n\r\nSchool Of Rock is a great feel-good comedy, fun for just about anyone of any age, kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won\'t be too harsh on the kids in the movie, they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack, it just wouldn\'t be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life, and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music, he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film, and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.\r\n\r\nThis comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. '),
(17, 'Carrey on Jim', '2017-11-07', 1, 17, 'Ace Ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a TV show, and in this case, that show was probably In Living Color, where Carrey got most of his publicity before he became famous as a movie actor. A quick look through Carrey\'s filmography will prove that Ace Ventura is the film that really acted as a springboard for his career. He had a few small roles in films previous to Ace Ventura, the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film Earth Girls Are Easy, but after Ace Ventura, his career skyrocketed. The Mask (hey, he\'s still new, give the guy a break), Dumb & Dumber, a sequel to Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy (oops), The Truman Show (ah, better), Man On The Moon, Me, Myself & Irene, The Grinch, and there\'s no end in sight.\r\n\r\nSure, Ace Ventura does not compare to half of these movies, and is clearly more on the side of the bone-headed comedy that he was doing on In Living Color, but his talent is unmistakable. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it. There\'s something about seeing a slob at a tremendously rich party who just doesn\'t care about the etiquette of the rich people. Did anyone not laugh when he was `testing\' the food at Ron Kamp\'s I\'m-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him? That whole scene at that party is classic!\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it only gets better with Ace\'s dealings with Lois Einhorn. The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey\'s immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim.'),
(18, 'Dog eat dog', '2017-12-05', 4, 18, 'Christopher Guest\'s Best of Show follows his great tradition of fake-documentaries which includes This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. This time, he takes a poke at dog shows, which is something no one has done before (I think). Here, he shows 5 different contenders (including himself which is one of the great parts of this film). Other contenders include Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock, Catherine O\'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey and in a exceptional effort as a man with 2 left feet, Eugene Levy (he also co-wrote the script with Guest). Often very funny, sometimes poignant, and like all of Guest\'s projects, never dissapointing, only liability might be that it isn\'t for all tastes (but hey, not everyone found 11 on a sound stsyem great either which seems odd).'),
(19, 'Never in doubt', '2018-02-07', 3, 19, 'Many people say that \"Mrs.Doubtfire\" is one of the funniest movies ever made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of animation in the first scene. Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn\'t act well in this movie. But, I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie.'),
(20, 'Vote for Pedro!', '2017-12-04', 1, 20, 'OK, I have seen a lot of negative reviews on this movie. It made me leery of even seeing it. I work at a video store so I get to see movies before their street release date. There were a few naysayers at work, but I rented it anyway. This was a rental well spent. This is the first movie I have seen in some time that doesn\'t have swear words or sex in any form so it is OK for any age. If you are or ever were just a little bit geeky, Napoleon is the hero for you. This movie is much funnier to a gen-x\'er. There are a lot of things that you won\'t \"get\" if you weren\'t a part of the 80\'s. All in all, I think that it is a great way to spend an evening. I am looking forward to seeing more from this writer/director.'),
(21, 'Alien Invasion', '2017-12-01', 3, 21, 'What\'s the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold\'s music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film.'),
(22, 'Don\'t be afraid of the dark', '2018-01-02', 3, 22, 'I will admit, I was already a fan of Serenity, Riddick Chronicles and all that, so I did go into this film with a bit of predetermined anticipation. On the flip side, I\'m not always that much of a Vin Deisel fan, in that he is somewhat mono-dimensional in his range of characters, but for the embodiment of Riddick, he does fit perfectly. As for the story and how it plays out, the pace is good, not too encumbered with gratuitous special effects and all that, but where it does fit, the CGI is well done and appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe one really glaring technical defect in this story is how everyone just gets out and starts walking around, breathing in the air without the slightest concern for differences in the atmosphere, microbes and so on, but this is a common flaw that is often somehow glossed over in many such stories, so I can\'t harp on that detail too much.\r\n\r\nAs for Radha Mitchell, she is smokin\' hot here, not in a ridiculous or frivolous way, but as her tough, seasoned interplanetary merchant marine ship\'s captain character \"Fry\", she nails it perfectly. If anything, she very much reminds me of Andrea Osvart (see her as the Hungarian assassin \"Gilda\" in the film \"Two Tigers\").'),
(23, 'A gigantic family film', '2017-12-06', 3, 23, 'All too often, \"family films\" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake. But then along comes something like \"The Iron Giant\", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\r\n\r\n\"The Iron Giant\" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways. Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula. The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey. The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney). No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot. At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\r\n\r\n\"The Iron Giant\" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well. It\'s sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget. Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue. Go see it! Tell your friends! Then go again! (Repeat as necessary.)'),

My husband took me along to the premier of Star Trek in London last night and thank you JJ you converted him in one film, I have been trying for 25 years! What JJ Abrams has done is create a film that can be enjoyed by all, its irrelevant whether or not you have seen Star Trek before, this film stands alone as brilliant entertainment. There are plenty of references to the original series to keep the fans happy. Of course there are going to be the \"hard core\" fans who will criticize certain aspects. I enjoyed seeing the lead actors imitate the characteristics of the original crew, Karl Urban as Dr Mcoy was particularly good. Good story line, plenty of humour, non-stop fast action, fantastic special effects, great acting from all the main \"crew\", Zacchary Quinto and Chris Pine especially. Can\'t wait for the next one to see more in-depth character development (of all the characters, not just Kirk and Spock and a moral dilemma which is at the heart of the best Star Trek.

Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba\'s palace, hoping to secure his friends\' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Luke, however, surrenders to Vader\'s soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader\'s boss - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire\'s triumph - unless things start to change quickly.'),

It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man\'s suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn\'t go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I\'ve always considered one of Marvel\'s most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic\'s 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn\'t do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr\'s performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don\'t come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn\'t quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own.'),

(29, 'Dark times for Donnie', '2017-12-18', 3, 29, 'In the end, _Donnie Darko_ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply. Donnie himself is a basically sweet-tempered (often courageous) young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation. His quest for meaning and self-discovery drives him to the fringes of our reality, which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves. The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed (such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl) or unappreciated (such as Karen, the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.)\r\n\r\nOf course, this movie far from polarizes its characters (indeed, polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish) and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque: Donnie\'s parents, who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused; the aforementioned self-helper Jim Cunningham, who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else; and Donnie\'s sister, struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child. And then there\'s Frank. All I can say here is that nothing can prepare you for or adequately describe Frank.\r\n\r\nProbably the best thing about this movie, though, is its incredible emotional range. It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states. The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist\'s office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I\'ve ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.\r\n\r\nFinally, the performances in this film are exquisite. The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing. That said, though, this film has a dismal future. Combine the fact that the large majority of the moviegoing public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane crashing into a building (this has got to be the very definition of bad timing) and it\'s pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground. However, if you are looking for a beautiful experience with a unique film, _Donnie Darko_ is just about as good as it gets.'),

The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest. Take note of Sonny Landham\'s comment;\"there\'s something out there,and it ain\'t no man.\r\n\r\nThe action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down. Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other. There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator). All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors. Very, very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.\r\n\r\nI shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potential/virgin viewers to find out for themselves. \"Predator\" is essentially one of the few action movies that truly lives up to its name and delivers the thrills and spills in no small amount and at breakneck speed.

(31, 'Horrifically Good', '2017-12-01', 1, 31, 'While \"The Babadook\" may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there\'s a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in \"Cabin in the Woods,\" this film\'s characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you\'re a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.\r\n\r\nDirector Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to grasp: that our biggest fear isn\'t of crazy killers or monsters or ghosts, but of ourselves—what lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with, the illusory veil of self-control. \r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends. Really, don\'t even watch the trailer.\r\n\r\nJust know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with total commitment and credibility. Kent\'s storytelling is utterly absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what\'s real and what\'s not that you can never be sure of yourself. \r\n\r\nWhat you make of \"The Babadook\" will depend on who you are. You might take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss. The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make sense of it yourself.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it\'s scary. But it\'s also touching and heartbreaking. While \"The Babadook\" belongs alongside other great psychological horror films, like \"The Innocents\" and \"The Haunting\" (1963), to classify it purely as \"horror\" really belittles its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality.'),
(32, 'Mist-erious', '2018-04-09', 3, 32, 'Thomas Jane (leading male and well known from The Punisher) has a brilliant and emotional portrayal of his character in a mind-blowing situation that we feel intimately associated with thanks to his acting and great directing. Laurie Holden (of X-Files and Silent Hill fame) has a more subdued performance but plays her role well and for any X-Files nut (such as myself) it\'s fun to see her in another movie. The cast is chock full of well known actors and some unknowns that really see and express the writer and directors vision. It pays off: They succeed in pulling you into a traumatic situation made worse with a mixture of religious zealotry, military conspiracy, and small-town ignorance that explodes in your face wondering if your humanity is worse off facing The Mist or the human condition.\r\n\r\nThere is no spoiler here but I will say this about the ending: It\'s what makes the movie and makes it so much better than most of the crap put out there in horror land. Yes, yes, getting cut in half and having limbs ripped-off is horrible. However it is the decisions we have to make that concern those we love and respect that can really drive one mad. The ending makes you look at yourself and wonder, if given the same situation, what you would have to do with the information you have available. It makes you think hard about your humanity and your soul and about what is right or wrong in any given situation involving our mortality.\r\n\r\nI would suggest this movie to anyone that likes horror or science fiction and wants something a little more intense than, say, Army of Darkness (one of my personal favorites for totally different reasons). This movie deals with serious issues we hear about daily. The mist is just a piece of Science Fiction thrown in to bring out the best...and worst in us.'),

The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see the genre hasn\'t completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery.\r\n\r\nThe only errors I could detect were the unconventional editing style, the transitions were a little dodgy lacking fluency, this left the film to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily forgiven. Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The film leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your back. An exceptional low budget indie horror film, strongly recommend.'),

Simón is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. Laura decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, Simón calls her to show the little cabin of his friend Tomás. The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and Simón vanishes. Laura feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate Laura invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery.\r\n\r\n\"El Orfanato\" is a creepy and spooky ghost story with a dark and very sad atmosphere. The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot).'),

The music is very nicely done, and, to me, the eerie opening scenes of the empty London streets are worth the price of admission all on their own. I\'m a stubborn viewer, and, normally, when a film benefits from early critical buzz in the manner that this one did, I find some excuse not to like it. But not this time; I\'m completely impressed. (Incidentally, I think it\'s interesting that while most horror films these days seem to have been inspired by knockoffs of knockoffs, \"28 Days Later\" apparently owes more to John Wyndham\'s classic disaster novel \"The Day of the Triffids\" than to anything else.

(38, 'I see dead people...', '2018-01-07', 4, 38, 'I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn\'t seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe\'s old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.\r\n\r\nThe acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis\' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment\'s loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I\'ve ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.\r\n\r\nThe plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)'),

It was tense, well acted, and the director made great use of the setting to scare the hell out of you.

In a three way spy battle, I would put Neeson edging out Bourne, who would be a step ahead of Bond.\r\n\r\nBetween the jaw-dropping action sequences was the subject matter of international trafficking, which was pretty miserable to watch.

It\'s almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I\'ve seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn\'t be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I\'m so happy to report just the opposite has happened.\r\n\r\nThe only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It\'s amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It\'s exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It\'s not a two dimensional \"team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho.\" Most don\'t like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren\'t used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work \"the other side of the fence\" so to speak. Then there\'s the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.\r\n\r\nThe entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I\'m so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he\'s locked up for the long haul because we don\'t need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we\'ve seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He\'s great but it\'s hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I\'m insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I\'m definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.\r\n\r\nI honestly don\'t want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It\'s how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you\'re obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever.

I don\'t usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it\'s not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience.

Given an A-picture budget by Warners, Siegel delivered a tremendously taut thriller, as provocatively amoral as anything he had done in his 20-year career of expert B-pics like The Killers.\r\n\r\nDirty Harry also gave Eastwood a definitive Hollywood identity after leaving spaghetti westerns behind. It may lack the humour of Siegel and Eastwood\'s first collaboration, Coogan\'s Bluff, but it packs a much more uneasy political punch.\r\n\r\nInspector Harry Callaghan is the taciturn, laconic spokesman of Nixon\'s Silent Majority, elevated to iconic status. His dialogue with criminals is delivered behind the barrel of a devastatingly phallic Magnum hand-gun. \"Feel lucky, punk?\" he taunts one wounded miscreant in a famous line he repeats at the end of the film.\r\n\r\nThere\'s just enough moral ambiguity about Harry in this film to escape it being an endorsement of vigilantism ? but if it poses resonating questions about how a liberal society can be held hostage by those outside the law, it also contrives a worryingly two-dimensional picture of psycho-killer Scorpio (Andy Robinson) - and of Harry, himself ? with which to frame those questions.\r\n\r\nMade by the veteran director in the same year as Hollywood-new wave young gun William Friedkin shot The French Connection, it\'s just as coolly authoritative and exciting. Siegel uses Bruce Surtees\' always serviceable photography of San Francisco locations with flair (years before, he had shot the low-budget but excellent The Line-Up there). The swooping helicopter shot out of the baseball stadium, as if to rush the audience away (either as witnesses or as voyeurs) as Eastwood presses his foot on Scorpio\'s wounded leg, shows Siegel\'s smooth mastery of the medium.\r\n\r\nSiegel made the insouciant Charley Varrick with Walter Matthau next, after which his career went into slow decline.'),

The characters are memorable, the script is great, and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The direction, editing, even the special effects are great. You have to love Short Round and Willy, the two new side kicks to Indiana\'s new adventure. Now I agree, Willy can get a little annoying here and there, but she was just so hilarious in that scene with the bugs and having to save Indiana and Short Round. Plus, Short Round has some of the most memorable lines of the entire series \"Okey, dokey, Dr. Jones, hold on to your potato!\", cheesy, but so funny. Harrison Ford still has Indiana down to a tee, this was the role that was meant for him.\r\n\r\nIn this prequel, we start off in China on a trade off gone wrong with Lao Che, he ends up meeting a beautiful and very high maintence American girl, Willie.

They wind up in India, where they find out about these rocks that can restore the village they\'re in, also the children have been kidnapped by Mola Ram and Indiana must free the kids and restore the rocks so the village can be safe again.\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fun sequel, I don\'t know why people complain so much about it.

It just has everything you could want: action, romance, alligators, and heart sacrifices, lol, OK, that sounded gross, just trust me this that this is such a fun movie.

What really makes this great though is De Palma\'s direction. Unlike the later flicks, key scenes are drawn out: there is a real Spense of suspense that is rarely achieved.

The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.\r\n\r\nThis film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays.

With Christopher Nolan of \"Memento\" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, \"Inception\" is a bloated failure.\r\n\r\nThe root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What\'s going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that\'s the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.\r\n\r\nThe matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn\'t nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it\'s time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.\r\n\r\nNolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination.

There is little variation and little originality in the presentation of this theme.\r\n\r\nI think the makers of the film were aware of this, and tried to make the film more interesting by arranging it chronologically in such a way that the process of the different pieces of the puzzle coming together is meant to be interesting. Both the film title and the introductory dialogue allude to this, but to me it seemed like a poor excuse not to tell rich, conclusive and well-developed stories.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate movies that do not follow a simplistic good/evil pattern; I would have liked to see a more developed and refined story of Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his interaction with Shaniqua and his father, for example. But there are too many plot lines to make any single one stand out, and as a consequence, the characters seem artificial rather than realistic. (As a European, I cannot judge whether the individual subcultures portrayed at all resemble reality.)

It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.\r\n\r\nAndrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes.

And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone\'s head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn\'t happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so cliché for an ending from the likes of Scorsese\'s genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can\'t give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less cliché or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I.

Danny Boyle and co. infuse every scene with energy, wowing viewers with panoramic cinematography and drilling the hard truths home when the time comes.\r\n\r\nRalston gets his arm trapped a mere 15 minutes in and from then on it\'s Man vs. Rock. Boyle brings his distinctive brand of energy to the potentially static set-up, with an unpredictable and often inspired soundtrack and the surreal tangents so successfully employed in his early classic, \'Trainspotting\'. Though Ralston himself may not move, his mind wanders through old memories and viewers are transported with him.\r\n\r\nBoyle has a talent for finding the life-affirming elements hidden deep within grim situations and \'127 Hours\' is nothing if not an exercise in hope and determination. Franco tracks Ralston\'s fight over the days with a sense of realism that brings the climber\'s plight into sharp focus, ensuring that there is much more to this film than limb-hacking.\r\n\r\nThe premise is handled well and the cast and crew know the strengths of the story; the scenery is beautiful and the human elements are as familiar as they are sad, brave and ultimately liberating.

I couldn\'t be further from the truth. This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.

Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife. Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.\r\n\r\nCarrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.\r\n\r\nOverall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I\'m still not sure.

One can\'t help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler. Why did Schindler do what he did? The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn\'t exactly go out of his way to be nice. Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive? Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint. It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material. He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are.

Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning.

So, if \"Eyes Wide Shut\" fails at the box-office, or is badly criticized by movie-goers, it has nothing to do with the film itself, but is more reflective of the movie-goers, and their inability to see further than what is presented to them on the screen. Life experience and a philosophical mind is also required to fully understand and enjoy this film. If you have ever thought of what role sex plays in your relationship, and what love and commitment really mean, you will understand this film. If you have ever considered what the difference between love and sex is, you will understand this film. If you have ever truly felt lust, you will understand this film. Be prepared to think.');

Fincher\'s film fails to present this trail of bread crumbs in the same enticing way that Oplev\'s did. Instead, we get a fast forward hyperspace logic jump when Blomkvist\'s daughter (out of nowhere) points out the vital clue that breaks the case, and then all related info is collected by Lisbeth in 5 minutes. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the following characters were shadows of themselves in the Fincher version: 1. Lisbeth Salander 2. Henrik Vanger 3. Martin Vanger 4. Bjurman The actors weren\'t horrible, but they were not as good as the ones in the Swedish version. \r\n\r\nLastly, there were key omissions and changes which, for me, were completely inexplicable and confusing. 1. Lisbeth\'s past, father, etc. was one or two lines of dialog. 2. Harriet Vanger in London? 3. Vanger does not tell Blomkvist that he knew Harriet.\r\n\r\nIt all adds up to a disappointing attempt to recreate the dark energy of Oplev\'s film. And the opening sequence was like a Tool video mixed with bad James Bond.'),

Alas, it was Christmas Day and you bet I was there to see the movie on opening day. I set my expectations really high on this film. I expected nothing short of brilliance with a film coming from director David Fincher, director of the masterful \"Zodiac\" and screenwriter Eric Roth, writer of the classic \"Forrest Gump\". The acting is brilliant in the movie. Brad Pitt and the marvelous Cate Blanchett share a fire that resonates so effortlessly out to the audience. Other performances are notable as well, such as Taraji P. Henson\'s as Benjamin\'s mother, and Tilda Swinton\'s as Benjamin\'s first lover. Another notable achievement in the film is the visual effects; none of it is overdone and it is quite convincing. The music in the film is great as well. The haunting and mythical music is composed by Alexandre Desplat. One thing that did surprise me in the film was the amount of comedy present, but I guess comedy\'s needed for a tale with such sorrow. I really do think that this film is a classic. And I would go and see it again. When I was walking out of the theater, some people complained that the movie was very good, but that it was too long. I disagree; I actually didn\'t want it to end. It\'s the perfect film to watch all snuggled up in a blanket during the dead of winter. All things aside, this movie is about the short time we\'re given with life and how we are to make the most of it. Even with a story as fictional as Benjamin Button\'s, the message rings true.'),

I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn\'t blown away, just kind of like whatever.\r\n\r\nWhen I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it\'s made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.'),

The action sequences kept me mindlessly entertained, and the Sherlock Holmes frivolity and eccentricities was somewhat amusing. Now let\'s see what\'s bad about this: Firstly, the true Sherlock Holmes is not a fighter, he uses his mind to solve problems instead. He and Dr. Watson have reserved mutual respect for each other, especially Dr. Watson towards his enigmatic friend admiring all the while his amazing intellectual capabilities. I can\'t believe how bad their relationship is portrayed in the movie, like two stoned teenagers constantly fighting. The Sherlock Holmes character is the major problem with this production: although funny the why was he portrayed like a genius a la Mozart with unkempt hair and disorderly attire is beyond me. The action sequences I guess are a compulsory necessity in a big-budgeted production like this in order to attract teens and make more money for the studios. I blame the success of the Indiana Jones action sequences for this mishap. Just as unfitting for an archaeologist professor, it\'s also contrary to Sherlock Holmes\' reason to use violence. But how else are we gonna have those compulsory big explosions? Lastly, the most important thing of all in a detective story, the case, rings closer to home to the original series, even though the explanations for the supposed supernatural elements at the end are themselves near impossible.\r\n\r\nObviously the creators of this film took great liberties with the poor Sherlock Holmes\' character, for he fights like Indiana Jones, laughs like Mozart and thinks somewhat like Sherlock Holmes; I guess he is Sherlock\'s bad ass, genius double, though not as tall and lanky.'),

It has loads of suspense, high tension, catchy and memorable dialogues, great actors, fabulous music score and an excellent director who didn\'t get scared off by protesters and other hypocrites. And yes, they are hypocrites in my mind, people who watch this movie are meant to be mature, thus denying sex is either hypocritical or prudish. If that\'s not your thing okay, then don\'t watch it but don\'t rate it low just because you can\'t handle it. Because the sex scenes are really just a few minutes long (I\'m European and they\'re really aren\'t that strong) but make up a large part of Catherine\'s character and are a fundamental part of the plot. The film would be unthinkable without them but shouldn\'t be reduced to them either.

I confess I need to see it again, since I saw it from 3 to 6 am, with very few hours of sleep on the night before. I suggest the ones who read the book to re-read it before they go see it - to add a little bit more perspective. To those who haven\'t, I wish you a lovely time at the movies - it really is pleasant to see.\r\n\r\nPraise to Audrey Tautou, a beautiful splendid actress, and all the other actors that don\'t need any more praise, like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Tom Hanks, who I didn\'t see fit the part at first, but who grew on me half-way through the movie, if not sooner.

Watching it again all these years later much of its impact has worn off, and yes, it has dated quite badly, but it\'s still a wonderfully entertaining movie, probably second only to Polanski\'s \'Rosemary\'s Baby\' in the Satanic/apocalyptic genre. It definitely wipes the floor with recent pretenders like \'Lost Souls\' and \'End Of Days\'.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons it still works is that the actors take the (sometimes silly) material so seriously. And when you have actors of the calibre of Gregory Peck and David Warner it certainly helps. Peck is utterly convincing as the Ambassador who doesn\'t want to believe the shocking facts staring him in the face, and Warner, who often found himself in second rate b-grade rubbish, obviously relished his role as the inquisitive reporter who helps convince Peck that things are not as normal as they seem. Along with Peckinpah\'s \'Cross Of Iron\', one of his best roles. Lee Remick is strong as Damien\'s worried mother, Billie Whitelaw chilling as the mysterious governess, and Patrick Troughton (\'Dr Who\' #2) is very good as a dying priest who knows the truth about the Thorn\'s son.\r\n\r\nForget the sequels, \'The Omen\' is classic Satanic schlock, and still has more than a few scares left in it.

It doesn\'t so much engage the viewer as assault him. \'\'Scarface\'\' is as voracious and unyielding a production as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer\'s imagination.\r\n\r\nMoroder\'s languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee. Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, it wails and gnashes, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony\'s inexorable fate.\r\n\r\nNot so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress, \'\'Scarface\'\' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.'),

The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. \'Drive\' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics.

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.'),

The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song \"Layla,\" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.\r\n'),

I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: \"Are you gonna bark all day...\", \"I\'ll make you my dog\'s bitch\". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don\'t know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there\'s a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino\'s best movie.

It seemed as if director Fleischer was trying to tell this story in the most fun possible way, and he succeeds with flying colors. The film is at its best when its loud and dumb but falters when it tries to be anything more than that.\r\n\r\nThe cast seems like they\'re having fun, especially Sean Penn who has a field day with his role as the villain Mickey Cohen.

The amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.\r\n\r\nNone of the characters in here, frankly, are \"good guys\" as Hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss Newman.

When the young boy\'s birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don\'t want to be ignored when the new one arrives.

Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler. The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy. The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages. One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales. In one scene, Princess Fiona\'s singing causes a bluebird to explode. And in another scene, the Magic Mirror\'s description of Snow White is \"She may live with seven men, but don\'t be fooled, she\'s not easy.\" While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp \"farting,\" that amuses children. The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations.

Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.\r\n\r\nI was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That\'s usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I\'m allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they\'re not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that\'s important for a good comedy. And it\'s hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She\'s an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she\'s doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. \r\n\r\nMovies like this aren\'t just being made for children exclusive... They\'re good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world.

Was `Bambi\' a quiet, gentle farewell, then? If you haven\'t seen it you could be forgiven for thinking so; and the slightly over-sugared opening scenes might confirm this view. But prepare to be jolted out of your seat. The forest contains darkness as well as light. The gunshots that ring out across the silences are truly alarming (and there are many ways Disney and Hand make them more alarming: consider the scene where a flock of birds are cowering in the grass, until one decides to fly into the air and risk death rather than put up with the suspense). Also worth noting about `Bambi\' is its use of psychological colour. In at least three key scenes, the colour scheme shifts wildly, not because the sun has set or anything of that kind, but in order to illustrate Bambi\'s psychological state. Particularly fine is the scene where he is running away from the clearing in fear and the world turns into just a few pale and dirty shades of yellow.\r\n\r\nThe greatest thing is the way Disney manages to convince us that there is nothing else in the world, outside the forest. Not once do we see a horizon. Nor do we sense one. By some standards not much happens in the forest - a few deaths, a few births, what else is new?

Voice characterisation is solid with, again, the girls and the minions standing out, although Steve Carell\'s Germanic/Russian Gru is also good fun. The 3D is occasionally effective but mostly irrelevant, although the end credits sequence, where various minions vie with each other to get closest to the camera, is well done and very funny.'),

Who doesn\'t remember digging under the porch, in creekbeds, hollowed out logs, etc to find the buried treasure you just KNOW is hidden there somewhere? The Goonies is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved this movie. It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids. Of course the movie has moments of predictability, and no, the villains aren\'t all that intimidating...they\'re actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in (don\'t judge by appearances, right vs. wrong, etc), overall, The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t a character in this movie I didn\'t fully enjoy watching...you have the dim-witted, evil Fratelli\'s, heavy-set, melodramatic Chunk, Data with his \"booty traps...that\'s what I said, booby traps\" galore, the odd-looking but loveable Sloth, and Mouth with his, well, Mouth. Those are only a few...there are many more. A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments (the Truffle Shuffle). I\'ve seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again.'),

They vary between being threatening, funny, amazing, beautiful and bizarre but all are highly imaginative. In fact, this movie is one of the most imaginative ever made, imagination being a quality that has disappeared almost completely from Hollywood over the last 40 years. It drags you into the world of its superb settings just the way for example \"King Kong\" did in 1933. This is just the kind of movie cinema was meant for, up from the days of its beginning (see for example \"Le Voyage Dans La Lune\" by Georges Méliès, 1902). \"Journey To The Center Of The Earth\" is pure cinema at its best.'),
(103, 'A whaley good film', '2017-11-01', 4, 103, 'When John Huston was casting for Moby Dick he got to make it on condition that he get a name actor to play Ahab. He went to Gregory Peck who was surprised by the offer. Given his image and the roles he had played up to that time, Peck thought he\'d be better cast as Starbuck the first mate. Nevertheless he agreed to do Ahab.\r\n\r\nPeck got mixed reviews at the time, but over the course of 50 years his performance has gotten better with time. The film itself which was shot in Ireland and Wales has also aged well. It\'s a nice depiction of life on a whaling ship in the 1840s and the crew of the Pequod are nicely cast in their roles.\r\n\r\nOrson Welles was set to do his own adaption of Moby Dick and canceled his film when he heard his friend John Huston was doing Moby Dick. Welles asked about doing Ahab, but was given the small role of Father Mapple, the minister who blesses the Pequod\'s voyage. In fact Huston gave Welles a free hand to do the scene as he saw fit and the results are gratifying.\r\n\r\nOf course Herman Melville\'s novel is about obsession and vengeance. I\'ve always thought the point of Moby Dick is that the evil white whale who Ahab so personalizes and demonizes is just a whale doing his whale thing trying to stay alive. It is in fact the whalers who hunt him and his kind. And Ahab losing his leg is what we would call an occupational accident. The evil is how Ahab seduces the whole crew into his own madness, even first mate Starbuck, played winningly by Leo Genn who is the voice of reason and civilization.\r\n\r\nOther cast members to note are Harry Andrews as second mate Stub, Friedrich Ledebuhr as Queequeg the Pacific Islander harpooner, and of course Richard Basehart as Ishmael who tells the tale.'),
(104, 'Best movie ever...?', '2017-09-01', 1, 104, 'When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn\'t make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don\'t know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly\'s (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you\'re not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.\r\n\r\nAmazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story.'),

This was a true man vs nature movie that really made me think about what I take for granted and I found myself wondering how I would react in such a situation.

It\'s an incredible film, a true cinematic achievement, possibly a classic and maybe will be the first 3D movie to break through and win the Best Picture Oscar. Some of the images were so beautiful that the audience gasped at many of them. I felt transported and like I was seeing a movie for the very first time. I haven\'t felt that sort of magic in a movie theater in a long, long time.\r\n\r\nI read the book and liked it and the film may even improve upon it which is kind of a miracle considering it\'s kids, animals and water just about all the time. The spiritual themes are simple and deep and raise more questions about faith and belief than answer anything. No preaching going on here and there could be. Without giving anything away, it\'s a wonderful story about storytelling and how telling our stories can get us through the most horrible life experiences and to help deal with the aftermath of them.'),
(107, 'It\'s long, but you don\'t need to escape!', '2017-10-01', 3, 107, '\"Wait a minute, you aren\'t seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there, and don\'t get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need\"\r\n\r\nSmart, witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges, The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right thru to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces allied with Elmer Bernstein\'s fabulous score never lets the blood settle, and in amongst the cute slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of it\'s type, in fact one of the best films ever.\r\n\r\nSturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.\r\n\r\nThe cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but it shouldn\'t be understated the input of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger. His scenes have a humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.'),

A jurassic parka.', '2017-09-14', 2, 108, 'JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it\'s premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, \"That\'s what I want to do.\" Sure the characters aren\'t deep and the dialogue isn\'t great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment.'),

The characters are humorous, the dialogue is witty and the cast is brilliant. It contains so many different elements which also make it a really good family film. Action, adventure, sword-fighting, pirates, romance, comedy and fantasy. It captures all the elements I could Whilst I still stand by the fact that the book is better, this is still my favourite film.'),

The book is all about the details and this adaptation totally misses those. The dialogue was by the numbers. Lots of exposition and at times flat out cheesy. Lots of tell, very little show. Little to no character development. Wade has zero arc in the movie. He\'s just kind of there. Nothing made me really care for him. I found myself bored many times and the only times I laughed where when I couldn\'t believe how comically bad this was. Massive disappointment.'),
(111, 'Possibly the best Harry Potter adaptation?', '2017-09-06', 1, 111, 'Alfonso Cuarón\'s masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script.\r\n\r\nFirst-time and young viewers will likely enjoy the film for its merits based on plot and \'adventure\' alone, but it takes multiple viewings and a critical eye to enjoy the abstract ideas and nuances. Cuarón himself credited the source material as being laden with real-world issues: oppression, racism, loneliness, power, friendship, justice and so forth.\r\n\r\nThis is the Harry Potter film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn\'t patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. For instance, the ending is bittersweet at best and retains a healthy amount of ambiguity.\r\n\r\nIf you\'ve never read the books or understood the acclaim of the series as a whole, watch Cuarón\'s \'Prisoner of Azkaban\' and you\'ll understand why this entry is clearly the zenith of the seven.'),

I\'m not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn\'t mind Arwen\'s inflation and I\'m actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).\r\n\r\nThe acting was flawless. As I\'ve read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn\'t play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat\'s off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who\'s intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It\'s EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.\r\n\r\nThe special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron\'s Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.'),

I couldn\'t see any flaw in this movie at all, they do change the way some events happened, but they\'re details and don\'t really change the story, actually you can tell they were needed.Jackson also adds some information, but he did say beforehand that he would, and is taken from other Tolkien stories, and as I haven\'t read them, I was very happy with the change because they were things I didn\'t know. The way the movie starts is very clever, and the whole introduction before the journey is almost exactly like the book, which I enjoyed very much. The fights scenes, just exactly as LOTR are INCREDIBLE,very well done, and with some funny moments as well. The cast is flawless, I think every actor portrays their character to perfection, I was happy with all the acting choices. The part of the book they picked to end the movie was great, the book though is basically divided into three main events, so it was somewhat predictable, but the scene they made to end the movie was perfect!!. So Basically if you\'re a Tolkien fan, or just LOTR-Hobbit fan you\'ll be puking rainbows of epicness throughout the movie.I had the luck to go to the premiere, but i\'m obviously gonna go watch it again on IMAX.'),

Even today, aged 23, working in the computer industry, I find myself slipping in the Neverending Story soundtrack in my CD player and dreaming away to Fantasia...\r\n\r\nThis movie the most beautiful and touching movies ever created.

Since I haven\'t read the novels, I can\'t speak to the faithfulness in comparison with the source material, but for a book that supposed to be rather violent, the movie was very tame. My biggest complaint would be the shaky-camera work, which, while useful in creating a sense of intensity or confusion, is quite headache-inducing and more importantly, obscures the action. Among the positives were Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson, who I felt gave rather entertaining performances, and the lighter, more humorous bits of the film were more enjoyable to watch. In regards to the preparation for the Games, I take issue with the backdrop of the whole affair, as it reeks of so-called \"reality\" TV, which I despise. But overall, I felt like this movie was like a watered-down rip-off of Battle Royale, without half of the emotional depth and pretty much none of the visceral content.');

Sure, there are fantasy films with far better special effects (THE MATRIX, JURASSIC PARK) better acting (the acting here is of the period!) but KING KONG is a film of tremendous excitement. The suspense, pacing, sensuality, violence all adds up to a blood pumping experience. We all read about the film\'s history, being made, released, censored, restored, and how it\'s been picked to itsy-bits by every arm-chair film \"expert\".\r\n\r\nWhat very few film-makers have focused on is the film-making itself in KING KONG. It has superb build-up. We are wondering what is on the island as we approach it. Then we wonder what is behind the wall on the island. Then we wonder what gigantic beast is sharing that frightening jungle with the rescuers, trying to save Fay Wray. The film is faultlessly edited. Many scenes begin or end with people running for their lives. Unneeded scenes just don\'t exsist (we go from Kong knocked out on Skull Island to his Broadway debut. We don\'t need to see what happens inbetween!) then there\'s Max Steiner\'s perfect music score. Before KONG, most music scores were borrowed snippets of classical or popular themes, but Steiner\'s score follows the action to an inch! Also, he does a great number of abstract musical strokes (I.e the clash of drums when Kong beats the giant snake to it\'s death. The lovely string piece that jumps to pulsating chase music in a milli-second.) When I hear of a friend say they never saw this film, it\'s like hearing a child say they never had ice cream.

From the multiple viewings during my childhood to the nostalgic sense of warmth I get from watching it nowadays, there is no way I can fault this science fiction masterpiece. One of Spielberg\'s greatest films, \'E.T.\' is a compassionate and emotionally-driven tale packed with clever storytelling, bold direction and state-of-the-art visual effects.. oh and it also features one of the most iconic images in cinema history.

The special effects are still special, and the characters are unforgettable.

The reverse evolution in childrens\' films is heartbreaking, as kids don\'t deserve to be talked down to so often in movies.

In today\'s world it may seem below standard compared to computer effects, but for those of us growing up in that time period, the Harryhausen style of special effects will continue to bring back warm memories of those years. With computer graphics, you see it and like it the first time you see it, but then many movies of today have the same and it becomes moot. Jason and the Argonaunts was one of those few movies at the time along with the Sinbad saga that lives on in your heart. The pace of the film is perfectly put together along with the many creatures, 7-headed hydra, huge fish-man, huge metal man and skeletons fighting is what makes it a classic which lives on in the hearts of those growing up in the sixties.');
